A virgin copy of these sources should include 12 files:

MANIFEST:	This file.

INSTALL:	Brief installation instructions.

NEWS:		Important changes.

Makefile:	A makefile to generate the binaries.

README.linux:	Documentation which may prove useful.

klogd.c:	Source code for the kernel log daemon.

klogd.h:	Global definitions required for the kernel log daemon.

ksym.c:		Source module for the kernel log daemon which implements
		kernel numeric address to symbol translations.

ksym_mod.c:	Source module which contains functions which allow ksym.c
		to resolve symbols found in loadable kernel modules.	

syslogd.c:	Source code for the system log daemon.

syslog.c:	A slightly modified version of the syslog.c file found in
		the standard libraries.  This special version is needed
		so that klogd will pass messages with kernel priority to
		the syslogd facility.

pidfile.c:	Source implementing utility functions which are useful
		for managing pid files.  Used by both syslogd and klogd.

pidfile.h:	Include file containing global definitions for the
		pid file utility functions.

version.h:	An include file for setting the version and patchlevel
		for the package.

syslog.conf:	A sample configuration file.  Note that this file uses
		extensions to the BSD syntax.  See the syslog.conf(5)
		manpage for more details.

syslog_tst.c:	A simple program to test the system log utility.

sysklogd.8:	Man page documenting the general characteristics of this
		package.

klogd.8:	Man page documenting the kernel log daemon.

oops.c:		C source for a loadable kernel module which can be used
		to generate a kernel protection fault.  This is used to
		test the address resolution capabilities of klogd.
